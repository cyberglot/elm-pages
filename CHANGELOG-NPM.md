# Changelog [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/elm-pages.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/elm-pages)

All notable changes to
[the `elm-pages` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-pages)
will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.9] - 2020-02-18

- Fix an issue with the NPM bundle (see https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/issues/71).
  Thank you for the fix [@icidasset](https://github.com/icidasset)! üôè

## [1.2.8] - 2020-02-08

### Fixed
- Colorize elm make output for initial elm-pages build step. See [#66](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/issues/66).
    Note, this patch still hasn't propogated through to `elm-webpack-loader` (see https://github.com/elm-community/elm-webpack-loader/issues/166).
    So there may still be non-colorized output for errors as you make changes while the dev server is running.

## [1.2.7] - 2020-02-03

### Fixed
- Don't serve fallback HTML from service worker when a page 404s... only when it fails to load (i.e. when
    you're offline). 404s will go through from the server if you're online now.

## [1.2.6] - 2020-02-03

### Fixed
- Only serve up the root route's HTML as a fallback when you're offline. This fixes the flash of root page content
    when you are online. When you're offline, you will currently still see the root page flash when you load a page,
    but you will be able to navigate to any cached pages as long as their content.json is in the service worker cache.

## [1.2.5] - 2020-01-31

### Fixed
- Make sure that pre-render trigger event fires to fix pre-rendering hanging.

## [1.2.4] - 2020-01-30

### Fixed
- Don't pre-fetch content.json files for unknown paths: https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/pull/60.
- Fix race condition where pre-rendered content sometimes didn't have body: https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/pull/62.

## [1.2.2] - 2020-01-27

### Fixed
- Dev server only terminates with unrecoverable build errors, and now will
     continue running with recoverable errors like metadata parsing errors.
     See [#58](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/pull/58).

### Added
- The `pagesInit` function that wraps the way you initialize your app in `index.js` now returns a Promise
    so you can wire up ports to it once it's initialized. See [#50](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/pull/50).

## [1.2.1] - 2020-01-20

### Fixed
- Removed a couple of debug console.log statements from the CLI.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-01-20

### Changed
- Changed the CLI generator to expect code from the new Elm package from the new
    `generateFiles` hook in `Pages.Platform.application`.

## [1.1.8] - 2020-01-20

### Fixed
- "Missing content" message no longer flashes between pre-rendered HTML and the Elm app hydrating and taking over the page. See [#48](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/pull/48).

## [1.1.7] - 2020-01-12

### Fixed
- Newlines and escaped double quotes (`"`s) are handled properly in content frontmatter now. See [#41](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/pull/41). Thank you [Luke](https://github.com/lukewestby)! üéâüôè

## [1.1.6] - 2020-01-04

### Added
- Added hot reloading for code changes! That means that in dev mode (`elm-pages develop`),
    you can change your code and the changes will be reloaded in your browser for you instantly.
    Note that changing files in your `content` folder won't yet be instantly reloaded, that will
    be a future task. See [#35](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/pull/35).

## [1.1.5] - 2020-01-03

### Fixed
- Fixed the bug that showed blank pages and failed page reloads when you change files in the `content` folder. Thank you so much [@danmarcab](https://github.com/danmarcab) for contributing the fix! See [#23](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/pull/23).

## [1.1.4] - 2020-01-03

### Changed
- Updated `favicons-webpack-plugin` to latest version. Had to upgrade to `html-webpack-plugin@4.0.0-beta.11`
  for this. See [#32](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/issues/32).

## [1.1.3] - 2020-01-03

*Check out [this upgrade checklist](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/blob/master/docs/upgrade-guide.md#upgrading-to-elm-package-110-and-npm-package-113) for more details and steps for upgrading your project.

### Changed
- Added `StaticHttp` requests in the CLI process (see the Elm package changelog).

## [1.0.41] - 2019-11-14

### Fixed
- Fixed a regression where elm-markup frontmatter was being incorrectly parsed as JSON
    (fixes [#20](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/issues/20)).

## [1.0.40] - 2019-11-04

### Fixed
- Generate files for extensions other than `.md` and `.emu` (fixes [#16](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/issues/16)).
   As always, be sure to also use the latest Elm package.

### Added
- Ability to use a custom port for dev server ([#10](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/pull/10); thank you [@leojpod](https://github.com/leojpod)! üéâ)

## [1.0.39] - 2019-10-18

### Fixed
- Use hidden `<div>` to listen for Elm view renders instead of wrapping entire
   page in an extra div. Fixes [#5](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/issues/5).

### Changed
- Add `onPageChange : PagePath Pages.PathKey -> userMsg` field to `Pages.application` config record.
    This is analagous to `onUrlChange` in `Browser.application`, except that you get a
    type-safe `PagePath Pages.PathKey` because it is guaranteed that you will only
    go to one of your static routes when this `Msg` is fired. Fixes [#4](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/issues/4).
